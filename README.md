# Conservation mode switcher tool for Lenovo Ideapad laptops.
It's tested on Fedora Linux, but it should work on most Linux distributions.
To install it, cd into the src directory and run "go install", this will install it in "$HOME/go/bin" by default.
After that add "~/go/bin" to PATH.
To run it, type "conservation" and add one of the two flags: "-on" or "-off".
